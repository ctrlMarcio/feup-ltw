        <h3>
            Candidacy to the elections for President of the Republic
        </h3>
        <p>
            In a world where hope has ended, as Saramago portrayed in his “Blindness”,
            we stop looking at the future, we stop seeing it. "This is blindness too," he said. Recalling Castrim,
            "Hope: it is the way the future speaks in our ears". At a time when so many do not see or hear the
            future to speak to them, the more necessary it is to know how to organize and open that future. To transform
            restlessness in struggle, convert unrest into trust. Confidence in a future built according to the
            dreams and projects to which we are entitled and which we do not want to give up. That we will not give up.

            Give Us Fully Automated Luxury Communism
        </h3>
        <p>
            Imagine a life in which all your basic needs were met, the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs forever
            lopped off. No concerns about college debt ruining your ability to buy a home. No worries about where meals
            would come from, or whether you would have enough cash to keep gas in the car. No problems paying medical
            bills. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/give-us-fully-automated-luxury-communism/592099/">more ...</a><br><br>

            Bourgeois and Proletarians
        </h3>
        <p>
            The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.<br>
            Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor
            and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now
            open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or
            in the common ruin of the contending classes. <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#007">more ...</a><br><br>
